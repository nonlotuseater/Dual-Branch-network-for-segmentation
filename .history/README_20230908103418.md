# Dual-Branch network for segmentation
 A demo for deep network in the task of the segmentation
- ### Some Introduction    
    With the widespread application of deep learning in segmentation tasks, segmentation techniques for special scenarios have also flourished. Cloud and cloud shadow research, as an important component of meteorological research, plays an important role in climate change and land cover classification. In this demo, a top-tier publication is selected for research and reproduction tasks, fully demonstrating the superior characteristics of a dual-branch neural network constructed with Transformers and Convolutions, improving the segmentation ability of clouds and cloud shadows at different scales, and further understanding the process of fusing features and spatial information at different levels during the encoding and decoding process, thus obtaining a segmentation network model with good performance.
